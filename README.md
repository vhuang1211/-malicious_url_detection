# Data Science for Cybersecurity - Final Project

This is my final project in the course of [Data Science for Cybersecurity](https://sites.google.com/view/mikehsiao/teaching/data-science-for-cybersecurity-2022?authuser=0). This project requires us to perform the analysis of security-related dataset using artificial intelligence techniques.


## Topic
**Detection of Malicious Websites Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques**


## Abstract
The number of malicious websites is increasing. People in Taiwan often receive phishing text messages containing malicious websites. Therefore, the detection of malicious websites is an important task in the cybersecurity field. In this project, I create some features of the URL based on several papers. Then, I use machine learning and deep learning techniques to perform the classification.
